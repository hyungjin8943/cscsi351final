in order to set up the database in your local computer 
you need to use two .sql query files to genernate it 

1. to make the "comment" data base 
  copy  the "comment.sql" which is in the documents folder 
and  paste to Run SQL query/queries on database comment

2. to make the "login" data base 
copy  the "login.sql" which is in the documents folder 
and  paste to Run SQL query/queries on database comment



then in order to login to the web 
username is "csci351"
password is "1234"

or 
username is "john"
password is "1234"


either two key works 

The "images" folder has the images that are used in the website
The "user_uploaded_images"is the folder were the user uploaded image goes in
